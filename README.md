# Movies_Web_Scraping_Test
Some web scraping with python in the page 'https://yts.mx/' to take movies data


This is a small test about web scraping. I used the web "https://yts.mx/" that have some films data.
I collected some data like title, year, rankings, and so on.
A Movie object order the datain attributes.
The data were packed in a Pandas DataFrame and then saved in a csv file.

The repository contains the notebook file, to use and test interactively, and the python file to execute directry.
The CSV file contains the output of the code.
